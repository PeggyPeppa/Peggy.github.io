<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a graduate student studying at the School of Vehicle and Mobility Engineering, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Professor Diange Yang. 

My research interest lies in autonomous driving map construction, which includes map representation structures, semantic segmentation, multi-sensor fusion, map prior construction, and offline post-processing modules. 

Outside of academia, I have a passion for music, traveling, and swimming. In terms of my life goals, I aspire to have a fulfilling career in a field that I am passionate about and to find a life partner who shares the journey with me. I also strive to make a positive impact by helping others realize their full potential. 

- My latest resume is available here: [CV](https://peggy.github.io/files/Resume.pdf) [Updated on 10 Mar, 2024].
- I am seeking 2024 summer intership. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:jpj22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)

# üìñ Summary
- Programming Language: Python, C, C++, Matlab
- English: CET4:598     CET6:541
-  Based on my project experience, I have gained knowledge and expertise in various aspects of AD maps, including algorithm review, dataset processing (AV2, NuScenes, Openlanev2), topological correlation research, and algorithm optimization. I am proficient in using the PyTorch deep learning framework and familiar with a range of open-source tools such as mmdet, Detectron2, and diffusers. These skills enable me to quickly adapt to internship requirements.
